IPAL questions may be used in a quiz and vice versa. Ready to use questions may also be obtained from the ComPADRE database.

The dynamic graphs displayed below the questions can be toggled from spreadsheet view (including student names) to an anonymous display of the answers for the active question -- a histogram for multiple choice questions and a one-line display for essay questions. While polling is on, a question may be answered multiple times until a second question is sent or polling is turned off.

A question may be sent more than once. The spreadsheet view displays the most recent answer submitted at any time.

Polling may be used
* To increase student involvement and participation
* To gauge student understanding and guide the pace of the class.
* To promote greater verbal classroom discussion.
